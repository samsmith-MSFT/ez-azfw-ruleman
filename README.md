# EZ AzFW Rule Manager

A cross-platform desktop app for managing [Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview) policy rules with a safe **draft → review → commit** workflow.

Instead of editing rules live in the Azure portal, you stage changes locally as a _candidate_, review the risk and the exact diff, and then commit them to Azure in one step — with a local history of every commit.

**[⬇ Download the latest version](https://github.com/samsmith-MSFT/ez-azfw-ruleman/releases/latest)** for Windows, macOS or Linux. Nothing to install: download it and run it.

## Features

- **Sign in your way** — interactive browser sign-in (Microsoft Entra ID via MSAL) or reuse an existing Azure CLI session. Switch between directories (tenants) you have access to.
- **Discovery** — finds Azure Firewalls and Firewall Policies across all your subscriptions using Azure Resource Graph.
- **Rule editing** — create and edit rule collection groups, rule collections, and DNAT, network, and application rules, with lookups for IP Groups, service tags, FQDN tags, and web categories.
- **Draft and commit** — changes are staged in a local candidate that survives restarts. Nothing is sent to Azure until you commit.
- **Review** — see a per-group diff and a risk assessment (e.g. overly broad sources, destinations, or ports) before committing. Concurrent changes made in Azure are detected using ETags.
- **Commit history** — every commit is recorded locally with what changed and its outcome.
- **Flow tester** — check which rule would match a given source, destination, protocol, and port.
- **CSV import and export** — bulk-edit rules in a spreadsheet and bring them back in.
- **Deploy new firewalls** — a guided wizard deploys a new Azure Firewall and Firewall Policy into a new or existing virtual network, or a Virtual WAN hub, using an ARM deployment.

## Download and run

Download the file for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/samsmith-MSFT/ez-azfw-ruleman/releases/latest). Every build is portable: there is nothing to install. Just download it and run it.

| Platform              | File                                              | How to run                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Windows (x64)         | `ez-azfw-ruleman-<version>-win-x64.exe`           | Double-click it                               |
| Windows (Arm64)       | `ez-azfw-ruleman-<version>-win-arm64.exe`         | Double-click it                               |
| macOS (Apple silicon) | `ez-azfw-ruleman-<version>-mac-arm64.zip`         | Unzip, then open **EZ AzFW Rule Manager.app** |
| macOS (Intel)         | `ez-azfw-ruleman-<version>-mac-x64.zip`           | Unzip, then open **EZ AzFW Rule Manager.app** |
| Linux (x64)           | `ez-azfw-ruleman-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `chmod +x` it, then run it                    |

The Windows executable unpacks itself to a temporary folder each time it starts, so it takes a few seconds longer to open than an installed app. Your drafts, history and sign-in are kept in your user profile (see [Where your data is stored](#where-your-data-is-stored)), not next to the executable, so you can move or replace it with a newer version freely.

### First launch on each OS

Release builds are not code-signed unless the maintainer has configured signing certificates, so your OS may warn you the first time you run the app.

- **Windows SmartScreen** — if you see "Windows protected your PC", select **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **macOS Gatekeeper** — if macOS says the app "cannot be opened" or "is damaged", right-click it and choose **Open**, or go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** and select **Open Anyway**. Alternatively, remove the quarantine flag:

  ```sh
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "EZ AzFW Rule Manager.app"
  ```

- **Linux** — AppImages need FUSE 2 (`sudo apt install libfuse2` on Ubuntu 22.04+). On Ubuntu 23.10 and later, AppArmor blocks the Chromium sandbox for apps outside system paths; if the app exits immediately, allow it with an AppArmor profile (`/etc/apparmor.d/ez-azfw-ruleman`):

  ```text
  abi <abi/4.0>,
  include <tunables/global>
  profile ez-azfw-ruleman /path/to/ez-azfw-ruleman-*.AppImage flags=(unconfined) {
    userns,
  }
  ```

  then run `sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/ez-azfw-ruleman`.

## Signing in

| Option         | How it works                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sign-in window | Opens a sign-in window in the app with an account picker, so you choose which account to use. Supports MFA.                                         |
| Browser (MSAL) | Opens your default browser (with its current profile) to sign in. Use it when Conditional Access requires a compliant device or managed browser.    |
| Azure CLI      | Uses the account you are signed in to with `az login`. Requires the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on `PATH`. |

By default, browser sign-in uses the Azure CLI's public client ID, so no app registration is needed. To use your own Entra app registration, set the `EZAZFW_CLIENT_ID` environment variable (a public client with `http://localhost` as a redirect URI). Set `EZAZFW_TENANT_ID` to pre-select a directory. The app deliberately ignores `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, which other tools often set for their own app registrations.

The app only requests the Azure Resource Manager scope (`https://management.azure.com/.default`); it can do nothing your account cannot already do in Azure.

## Required Azure permissions

Access is governed by Azure RBAC on your own account:

| Task                                             | Minimum role                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browse firewalls, policies, rules, and IP Groups | **Reader** on the subscriptions or resource groups                                                                                                          |
| Commit rule changes                              | **Network Contributor** on the firewall policy (or a custom role with `Microsoft.Network/firewallPolicies/ruleCollectionGroups/read` and `/write`)          |
| Reference IP Groups in rules                     | `Microsoft.Network/ipGroups/join/action` (included in Network Contributor) on the IP Groups                                                                 |
| Deploy a new firewall                            | **Contributor** (or Network Contributor plus deployment rights) on the target resource group; on the subscription if the wizard creates new resource groups |

## Where your data is stored

Everything the app keeps is stored locally in your user profile, in an `ez-azfw-ruleman` folder:

| OS      | Location                                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\ez-azfw-ruleman`                     |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/ez-azfw-ruleman` |
| Linux   | `~/.config/ez-azfw-ruleman`                     |

- `ez-azfw-ruleman-state.json` — draft (candidate) changes and commit history.
- `msal-cache.bin` — the sign-in token cache, **encrypted** with the OS key store (DPAPI on Windows, Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux). If no secure key store is available (e.g. Linux without a keyring), tokens are never written to disk and you sign in again each session.

Delete the folder to reset the app. No telemetry is collected; the app talks only to Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Resource Manager.

## Development

Requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22 or later and npm. `npm run dist` builds for the OS it runs on (Windows, macOS or Linux); use CI to build the others.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/samsmith-MSFT/ez-azfw-ruleman.git
cd ez-azfw-ruleman
npm ci
npm start
```

Set `EZAZFW_DEVTOOLS=1` to open the developer tools on start in development.

## Releasing

1. Add a `## [1.2.3] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to `CHANGELOG.md` and bump the version: `npm version <major|minor|patch> --no-git-tag-version`.
2. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin main v1.2.3`.
3. The [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds portable executables for Windows (x64 and Arm64), macOS (arm64 and x64) and Linux (x64) into a draft release. Once **every** build succeeds, it adds `SHA256SUMS.txt`, writes the release notes (a download table plus that version's CHANGELOG section, from [`.github/release-notes.md`](.github/release-notes.md)), and publishes the release as **Latest**.

The tag must match the `version` in `package.json`. If a build fails, the release stays a draft. Fix the problem, then re-run the failed jobs (or run the workflow manually with the tag).

### Code signing (optional)

Builds are unsigned unless these repository secrets are set:

| Secret                                                     | Purpose                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`          | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` and its password  |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`                                   | Signing identity, e.g. `Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)` |
| `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Notarization credentials (used only when the app is signed)      |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`      | Base64-encoded Authenticode `.pfx` and its password              |

Locally, the same settings are read from environment variables (`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` or `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_FILE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`).
